# java-zoos

A student that completes this project shows that they can:
* Use Custom Queries usng Spring-Data
* Implement OAuth2 security with different security roles
* Implement Many-to-Many and One-to-Many relations with auditing fields

## Introduction

This is a basic database scheme with zoos, phone number and animals at the zoo. You are given an initial application which you are to update as specified.

## Instructions

This is REST API server which stores data in an H2 database. The table layouts should be

* Zoo
  * zooid - long primary key
  * zooname - String

* Telephone
  * phoneid - long primary key
  * phonetype - String
  * phonenumber - String
  * zooid - foreign key
  
There is a one to many relationship between zoos and telephones. One zoo can have multiple phone numbers but each phone number can only belong to one zoo.

* Animal
  * animalid - long primary key
  * animaltype - String

There is a many to many relationship between zoos and animals. A zoo may have many animal types and an animal type may be at many zoos.

The data.sql file seeds the Zoo Database

### The following end points should be working

* GET /zoos/zoos - returns all zoos with their phone numbers and animals

For the PUT and POST you can assume you are sent all the data with the appropriate ids included

* PUT /admin/zoos/{id} - update the zoo referenced by the id number with the provided information
  * Update the Zoo and associated phone number. This does NOT address the Zoo Animal combinations! That would be a separate end point

* POST /admin/zoos - add the zoo
  * Add the Zoo and associated phone number(s). This does NOT address the Zoo Animal combinations! That would be a separate end point.
  * In the header return as the location of the newly created zoo POST /admin/zoos/{id}

* DELETE /admin/zoos/{id} - delete the zoo, associated phone numbers, and zoo animals combination associated with this zoo id
  * This should delete the Zoo, associated telephone numbers, and zoo animals combinations associated with this zoo.


### You will need to get the following end points working

* GET /animals/count -  that returns a JSON object list listing the animals and a count of how many zoos where they can be found. Use a custom query for this. 

* GET /zoos/zoos/{id} - returns all information related to a zoo based on its id

* GET /zoos/{name} - returns all information related to a zoo based on its full name


### Once the end points are working, enable OAuth2 Security using the following guidelines

* ROLE ADMIN should be allowed to access /admin /animals /zoos

* ROLE ZOODATA should be allowed to access /zoos

* ROLE ANIMALDATA should be allowed to access /animals

* ROLE MGR (manager) should be allowed access /animals /zoos.


### Stretch Goals

* Expose the end point GET /zoos/zoos/(id) - returns the zoo identified by id with its phone numbers and animals

* In the PUT /admin/zoos endpoint, return in the header a link to the zoo created with the endpoint /zoos/zoos/{id}

* Expose the end point DELETE /admin/zoos/{zooid}/animals/{animalid} - delete the zoo animal combination based off of ids. 
  * Hint: @PathVariable("zooid") long zooid, @PathVariable("animalid") long animalid

* Expose the end point POST /admin/zoos/{zooid}/animals/{animalid} - adds the zoo animal combination based off of ids. 
  * Hint: @PathVariable("zooid") long zooid, @PathVariable("animalid") long animalid

* give /ADMIN access to /users
  * add end point /users/add to add a new user
  * add end point /users/delete/{id} to delete a user based off of id
  * add end point /users/viewall to show all the users
  * add end point /users/view/{id} to show a user based off of if
